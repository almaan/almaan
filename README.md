# Hello World ðŸ‘‹

## Something brief about me

- I'm a computational biologist with a passion for development of tools to analyze big data, where I've mainly - so far - focused on spatial transcriptomics and single cell data. Currently, I'm a PhD student in the [spatial research group](https://www.spatialresearch.org/) headed by Joakim Lundeberg at SciLifeLab Stockholm (Sweden).
- My interests cover a vast range of subjects, but to mention a few: Statstical Inference, Machine Learning, Dynamical Systems, and Programming (in general).
- Pipelines - while invaluable - are the killer of all my joy.
- Mountains, running and hiking are my big pleasures; if not in front of a computer, you'll most likely find me passing time outdoors.

## Where to find me
- You can find me on twitter, where I occasionally share short reviews of comp. bio papers, news in the same field or other tidbits related to my interests.
