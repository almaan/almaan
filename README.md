# Hello World 👋

## Something brief about me

🐥 in 🇸🇪 | 🏠 in 🇺🇸 | :heart: with 🏃 

- **Who**: I'm Alma Andersson, a Sr. AI Scientist at Genentech, working in the AI/ML Department as a part of the spatially focused team. I completed my PhD in 2019 after 2.5 amazing years in the Lundeberg lab focusing on computational method development for analysis of spatial-omics data.
- **Work**: Currently, a lot of my work focuses on designing and implementing computational models designed to capture the fundamental elements of tissue biology. This results in a mixture of probabilistic, dynamic, generative, and standard ML models. The main data modalities is spatial data and images.
- **Interests**:
  - Technical: generative learning, uncertainty estimates, foundational models, dynamical systems, programming
  - Non-technical: running (my big passion), sports science, mountain climbing/hiking, video editing, modern and ancient history
